                of traffic to your website through organic search engine results...</p>

            <h3>1. Organic Search is Most Often the Primary Source of Website Traffic.</h3>

                buyer funnel...</p>

            <h3>2. It Supports Content Marketing.</h3>
            <p>Original content and SEO work hand in hand, by creating helpful content for visitors, including blog
                articles, videos, and infographics...</p>

                <h3>3. SEO Provides 24/7 Promotion.</h3>
                <p>Search engine optimization efforts do not stop after work hours. Content does not disappear after a budget runs out,
                such as with paid advertising. Rankings achieved through SEO promote your website 24/7, taking absolute advantage of the
                (at least) 60,000 Google searches occurring every second. Once more, SEO is unique because it allows your company to
                reach users while they‚Äôre searching for you ‚Äì not on a billboard spotted on the way out of town.Ôªø</p>

                    <h3>4. You can move ahead of the competition.</h3>
                    <p>Today, SEO is widely considered a staple of any marketing strategy. In fact, 61% of marketers say that improving their
                    SEO and improving their online presence is a top priority. This means that your competitors are likely already taking
                    steps to establish high rankings in search results. And with an SEO strategy of your own, you can keep up with ‚Äî and
                    ideally, move ahead of ‚Äî them to stay competitive within your industry.</p>


                        <h3>5. You Get Quantifiable Results.</h3>
                        <p>With SEO, you can track changes in rankings, conversions and website traffic. Platforms like Google Analytics provide a
                        comprehensive suite of information, allowing you to drill down to an incredibly granular level. For example, you can see
                        every website user's buying journey ‚Äî including the pages they engaged with, the keywords they used to search and
                        whether they completed specific actions. You can use these insights to adjust and improve your SEO strategy.</p>
