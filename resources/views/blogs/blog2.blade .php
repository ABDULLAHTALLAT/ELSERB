            <h2>What is SEO?</h2>
            <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the practice of increasing the quality and quantity
                of traffic to your website through organic search engine results...</p>

            <h3>1. Organic Search is Most Often the Primary Source of Website Traffic.</h3>
            <p>Organic search is a massive part of most businesses’ website performance and a critical component of the
                buyer funnel...</p>

            <h3>2. It Supports Content Marketing.</h3>
            <p>Original content and SEO work hand in hand, by creating helpful content for visitors, including blog
                articles, videos, and infographics...</p>

            <h3>3. SEO Provides 24/7 Promotion.</h3>
            <p>Search engine optimization efforts do not stop after work hours. Content does not disappear after a
                budget runs out,
                such as with paid advertising. Rankings achieved through SEO promote your website 24/7, taking absolute
                advantage of the
                (at least) 60,000 Google searches occurring every second. Once more, SEO is unique because it allows
                your company to
                reach users while they’re searching for you – not on a billboard spotted on the way out of town.﻿</p>

            <h3>4. You can move ahead of the competition.</h3>
            <p>Today, SEO is widely considered a staple of any marketing strategy. In fact, 61% of marketers say that
                improving their
                SEO and improving their online presence is a top priority. This means that your competitors are likely
                already taking
                steps to establish high rankings in search results. And with an SEO strategy of your own, you can keep
                up with — and
                ideally, move ahead of — them to stay competitive within your industry.</p>


            <h3>5. You Get Quantifiable Results.</h3>
            <p>With SEO, you can track changes in rankings, conversions and website traffic. Platforms like Google
                Analytics provide a
                comprehensive suite of information, allowing you to drill down to an incredibly granular level. For
                example, you can see
                every website user's buying journey — including the pages they engaged with, the keywords they used to
                search and
                whether they completed specific actions. You can use these insights to adjust and improve your SEO
                strategy.</p>


            <p>Today, SEO is an essential part of any marketing strategy. So, to answer the question, “do your Website
                really need
                it?”, the simplest explanation is that it’s the best way to improve your online visibility and reach
                consumers as
                they’re actively searching for information. It also presents a wealth of benefits that no other digital
                marketing
                tactic can offer. Beyond that, the right strategy can also help you improve your brand’s PR and move
                ahead of your
                competitors.</p>
